## Project Details

The starter project had some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. The student needed to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one.

## How to Play

There are 8 pairs of cards spread across the board with their symbols hidden. The goal of the game is to find cards with matching symbols in the smallest amount of moves.

* Checking if two cards match counts as one move.
* After checking two cards, if their symbols don't match, the cards are flipped face down again.
* If the symbols do match, the cards stay face up.
* The star rating will change depending on the amount of moves it takes to complete the game.
* Once you find all 8 pairs, you win the game.
* To restart the game press the restart button.
